1. Comment:
The paper is missing a clear definition of "I/O path" with few
examples.

Reply:
Our definition of I/O path in Section 2.2 (Model of the I/O path) was quite short and without much detail. We now added a more specific defintion with an additional example and more details.  

Old version:
[...] I/O path, which is the path from the invoking processor to the
storage medium that contains/will store the data (larger accesses may
be distributed across multiple servers).
The data read/written is passed through the levels of the memory hierarchy.

New version:
The I/O path is the interaction between all components that are
involved in the transfer of the data read or written.
For example, for a node local file system, this includes, operating
system, memory and storage device / medium. Remote systems add network
traffic and usually server sided components.
Usually, in parallel file systems the I/O of the client is transferred
through operating system, client side file system modules, network,
file system servers, storage devices and ultimately media.
In several of these steps, data may be cached in memory and
optimizations can take place.

2. Comment:
The paper compares accuracy of ANN solution with linear model. More models are said to be presented in referenced link[12], but some brief overview would be useful here as well.

Reply:
A summarizing list about models that were examined in the reference, but are not analyzed in detail in the paper was added.

Added list:
